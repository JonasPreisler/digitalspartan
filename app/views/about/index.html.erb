<h2><u>What is Digital Spartan?</u></h2>
Marketplace for digital entrepreneurs.
</br>
</br>
We focus on the now and the future, that's why Digital Spartan starts with Messenger chatbots (active, not templates).
</br>
</br>
Later on, we'll include augmented reality, voice bots, and what else we believe might be the future.

<h2><u>Roadmap</u></h2>

<b>May 2018:</b> Go online. Blogging. Social media.
</br>
</br>
<b>June 2018:</b> Add categories such as 3d Models, Mockup, Template, Email List etc.
</br>
</br>
Yeah I know it's not a very detailed or longterm plan, but I'm kind of developing it on the go.
